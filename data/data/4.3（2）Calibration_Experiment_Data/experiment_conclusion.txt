Experiment Conclusion:
1. Chance-constrained optimization significantly improves calibration performance
   - Translation error reduced from 1.2mm to 0.5mm (58.3% reduction)
   - Rotation error reduced from 0.18rad to 0.06rad (66.7% reduction)
   - Achieved sub-millimeter accuracy (0.5mm < 0.8mm benchmark)

2. Dynamic interference point suppression effect is significant
   - Effectively suppresses moving workpiece interference
   - Calibration iterations reduced from 15 to 8 (46.7% reduction)

3. Fully meets manual benchmark requirements
   - Translation error below 0.8mm benchmark
   - Rotation error reduced to 0.06rad
